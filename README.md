# Breast Cancer Prediction Models Comparison

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and comparison of several machine learning algorithms applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal of this project is to identify the most effective model for predicting breast cancer based on various features derived from digitized images of breast mass.

## Algorithms Compared

- **Linear Regression**: Used as a baseline for performance comparison.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
- **Decision Tree**: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees, typically trained with the "bagging" method.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features such as the radius, texture, perimeter, and area of the cancer cells, among others.

## Features

- 30 features including mean, error, and worst values for 10 different characteristics of the cancer cells.
- 569 instances with 212 malign and 357 benign instances.
